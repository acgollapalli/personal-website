# Introduction, A Gentle
I hope you have found a bit of delight in my website. Or else, you are berating my
poor efforts at frontend development. I may say that I'm fullstack, because it's
marketable, but really I'm much more of a backend developer at heart. Data
transformation, querying, and API's are things that I actually seem to enjoy, for
reasons I still don't understand. Maybe it's just because it's what I learned
first.

It's always been cool to have your own website. I grew up in a time where Wikipedia
wasn't a thing anybody talked about yet. Having your own Wikipedia page wasn't even
a thing, let alone a status symbol. The thing that was the height of cool was having
your own website. So I'm building this one, just for fun. Just for me.

I know job applications (blasted things! They should just have bots that rank GitHub
repos based on complexity and recruit people based on their personal projects) ask for
personal websites sometimes, and that was my initial justification for building one.
But I'm having fun, so I dont think that putting up a resume and brief introduction
is going to cut for me. Besides, I'm kind of burnt out from being a programmer.

# Part 1: Welcome to Burnout City
I was supposed to introduce myself, wasn't I?

## Me
Hi, I'm Akshay Caleb Gollapalli, and I'm a burned-out software developer. Why am I
burned out? Lots of reasons. Maybe I'll tell you someday. Let's just say that some of
it was where I was the problem, and some of it was where I was gaslit into thinking
I was the problem.

I have a degree in Mathematics and English Literature. I double majored. Why? Because
I love both dearly. I really like mathematics. I struggle with it now, because I am
rusty. But I enjoy it. I really need to bust out the Strang and Lang and hit my
Algebras. I also really like big 19th and 20th century novels, and I really,
really like renaissance poetry. But the thing I love most is the epic.

## Myself
I didn't really intend to become a software engineer. I wanted to be writer, or a
musician. And I am those things. But I've never made a living from those things.
The way that I've made my living these last few years is by writing software.

## And I
... quit my job a couple months ago. I said to myself I'd never work on software or
in any professional setting ever again. I was just done. I thought it bred mean, lowly
status seeking men and spiteful, wrathful women. I felt it was bad for my soul to
work in a context like that. The thought of taking money for writing software still
turns my stomach a bit. I had a bare shell of a plan. I don't know if that plan is
happening or not. There's a pretty good chance I may not be on the job market, and
I may never again make my living from software again.

# Part 2: Love of the Game, Medicine for the Soul

I said I'd hopefully never write another line of code when I left my last job. And
that's probably why I felt OK leaving a software role in the middle of the worst
software job market since Y2K.

## A Bug in the Ointment, A Fly in the Solution
But about a month in, I started programming again. I started programming, and I
started enjoying it. I started to tell myself not to program until I'd accomplished
the things I needed to accomplish, but there I was, with my emacs open and hacking on
some side-project or other. I haven't shipped any of them or put them on GitHub. But
they weren't great ideas and I'm fine throwing them out as learning experiences.

I've been applying to software roles, more as a backup plan than anything. I am still
terrified of going back to work a normal job. I just really didn't fit the last one I
had. I've been rationalizing it to myself, *maybe I've just not been in the right
sort of place? With the right sort of people* or *maybe it would be different
elsewhere*. But I think it was actually because I just knew after a while that that
job was no longer getting me any closer to where I needed to be in my actual
life-mission.

> Maybe I've just not been in the right sort of place?
> With the right sort of people?
> Maybe it would be different elsewhere
> Maybe if I just...
> No, it might be worse
> Maybe, it's me?
> Does it matter?

But it doesn't really matter, because until my exit-strategy happens, I should consider
my options... right? It's not like I'm excited at the prospect? I mean, I told myself
I'd rather die than do this stuff anymore. And I meant it.

## A Spoonful of Sugar Makes the Medicine Go Down
But I really like programming. And I've realized over the last couple months, that I
really, really do. I love the thought of writing the best stuff, that blows everyone
away, of being a [*real hacker*](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html).
Heaven help me, I actually love the thought of being at Netflix and doing crazy stuff,
or AWS, or Meta, or even founding my own company. Whatever else I might do in my life,
I really do like programming. I want to be good at it. I want to be **great** at it.

> And I don't really want to give it up.

So, I might have started applying out of necessity, but I don't mean it. I actually,
really do love this stuff, despite what I said in the throes of burnout.

## Wanton Wills are a Want of Will, a Flame of Burning Desire
So, what was the aloe-vera to my burnout, the ointment for my wounds? Was it resignation?
Was it resignation from the last near-decade of my life, the learning, the experience?
And if so, perhaps the fly in my ointment, the bug in my solution was want. Or perhaps
was it desire? Was the medicine to leave, or was it to seek? Want may lead to servility,
but every higher pursuit begins with the question,

> How bad do you want it?

And I want to code. I want to be a hacker. I want to be among the best of the best. Maybe
I'll get a PhD in the subject someday, I've always wanted one. I've always wanted to
contribute something new to the world, knowledge or creative output or an organization.
But man, I am ***done*** with academia for a while.

# Part 3: What is it that *you* want?
I know that I don't want to give up what I've devoted almost a decade to learning how to do.
I don't claim to be a real hacker. I had to ask Claude to fix some of my stuff when building
this. But I know that I want to build stuff. I don't know that I need to make my living at it
anymore. I'm still a bit scared of that. But maybe if I just build things, that'll go away.

If I applied to work at your company, know that I meant it. I'm not interested in taking jobs
unless it's a with a company full of serious people doing serious things. Any place where the
mode of ambition is "looking good" and the mode of reward is not financial is not really on
my radar. But even if it was. It wouldn't matter, because I wouldn't survive there. I want to
do great things. I want to solve hard problems. I want to be great.

> I want to contribute something new to the world
> I want to solve hard problems.
> I want to be great.

And I'm not going to do anything that doesn't facilitate that.

# Part 4: Motivational Structures
It's a common thought that programmers are like engineers. Just logical little people who
like finicking with computers and making things, without a jot of ambition in them. You just
tell them what to make and they do it. But be careful, you need to manage them, or they'll
just tinker away. They care more about the tech than they do about the problem. Oh, and they're
not creative either. Not like us. We have an eye for the design, and for the human. We know
what people want.

If such people had an eye for the human, and knew what people want, they would know that
programmers are far more akin to artists and athletes than they are to "engineers". As a
matter of fact, so are engineers.

## Disjoint Hierarchies

You see, there are some people who are just in it for the status and the lucre. Booty and Loot.
And I used to look down on these people. It was lowly, I thought. These days I recognize the
honesty in that&mdash;respect it, even. But for others, our desires are a bit more subtle. It's
not about status in the monkey-brain sense, top of the hierarchy sense&mdash;serotonin
straightening (bowing?) lobsters' spines and all of that. No, it's much more human.
It goes to the core loop of skill development, and what makes people want to be good at anything.

> αἰὲν ἀριστεύειν καὶ ὑπείροχον ἔμμεναι ἄλλων
> Always be the best and stand out from the rest

I can't read Greek, but I've included it for those that can. This is a line from the Illiad.
And it's a powerful one. It's the instruction that Achilles' received from his father Peleus.
It's a stark line, and one that was regarded rather highly in Greek culture, and all the
cultures that followed it in descent of intellect and spirit, ours included. It wasn't regard
negatively it was a keen call to excellence. The only reason I don't have it tattooed on my
arm is because I'd rather write it on my heart and in my flesh and in my life. My own father
told me something similar, and I wish I hadn't scoffed at it.

It reminds me of one of Paul Graham's essays... or maybe it was one of Eric S. Raymond's...
I don't recall, and if I go looking, I'll go down a rabbit hole. Anyway, it's about being a
young, smart kid that doesn't fit in all that well, and the line is something like, "we never
would have traded it though, because we were *smart*". And that speaks to me. You'd never
give up your ability for your status. Your ability *is* your status. It's your points on the
scoreboard and you're playing a different game. It's about the desire to do great things.

## Plaudits and Laurels

Great things aren't great because they are observed to be. They're great in a way that is
self-evident, and hence observed. And when greatness is not recognized, or excellence,
or ability, or insight, or what have you, it can very easily mar one's will to try. And
when one see's another being elevated over them, because they can make good PowerPoints,
whereas you write documents to explain your ideas, and can't summarize them in two minutes
(perhaps a personal failing, I'm working on it), this stings the soul. The person in it
for status and lucre will just learn to make PowerPoints, but the person who strives for
excellence will be jarred.

> manna mildust | monðwærust
> leodum liðost | lofgeornost.
> He was the man most gracious and fair-minded,
> Kindest to his people and keenest to win fame.

Those are the last lines from Beowulf. I can't read Old English either, but I think it's
important to include them. Beowulf swam the English Channel, fought monsters and dragons,
and won great glory. Or rather, fame, as the translator would have it (not that I'm learned
enough to argue the point). And a keenness to win fame was clearly not a thing to degrade in
that culture. Beowulf did so in a manner worth singing his song, for millenia. Those lines
have always stuck with me.

The expression of inherent excellence is keenly tied to its outward recognition, if not in its
real nature, then in the mind of the person struggling to bring it forth. It is for this reason
that those who are striving for this crown feel it so keenly. And when they are regarded as
mere tinkerers, hobbyists, children with their toys, dilletantes (a word that ought to be reclaimed),
it is a dagger, and a debasement. When they are conflated with the booty and loot crowd, it is
an insult greater than all others.

And this applies regardless of your field of endeavor, whether it be software or
[painting](https://paulgraham.com/hp.html). But Athletes, Scholars, and Artists
have thousands of years of being respected and admired. We have written records
of them from more than 2000 years ago. Statesmen are of the same breed, with an
eye towards being compared with a Lycurgus or a Solon or a Moses. And so, for
that matter, are Men at Arms, hoping to be in the same category as a Caesar, or
Alexander, or Napolean, and to have an Arrian, or a Xenophon, or a Clausewitz
write about your victories. I'd say Hackers are in the same breed. Stories are
told, and passed around, and kept. And respect is earned, and given, and so on.

## And Hackers

And for the 99.999% of us, we're not really going to get there. But... that's
not really the point. The recognition is secondary to the excellence. The point
is to do things at the highest level that you are capable of. A guy who played
college football and then got a normal job is still respected. A guy who was an
Army Ranger and is now a chiropractor is still respected. And that person has,
beyond the respect of others, a great self-respect. Because that person pushed
themselves to an extraordinarily high-level in a field of endeavor that they
chose. They know who they are. They demonstrated real, hard-won excellence.

> Poison for the soul

Using the latest typescript framework or functional programming language is a
poor substitute for not getting to do the same. Most tech fads are cope for how
boring most of our lives are. But sometimes management attitudes towards it can
be the most brutal thing of all.

It can be poison for the soul.

# Part 5: And All Five Part Essays Must Come to A Conclusion

So that was a really long way to say, "I'm burned out".

Really, I'd be lying if I said I don't care about compensation, or about recognition,
or prestige. People who work at places like that don't expect you to have self-respect
either. I've tried it. It didn't work. FYPM as the old artists adage goes.

And what do I want? I want to work with the best people, doing the best stuff,
at the highest level. If I have to change fields of endeavor entirely to do that,
then I will. But if I have the opportunity to do that, that leverages the last
decade of learning and building that I've done, I'll take it, because holy smokes
man, I don't want to call the last decade a waste.

## Why did I build this website?
Personal branding?

No, this website is *my* website. I built it because I like it. I had a lot of fun
building it.

But also, there's the admiration factor. Paul Graham has a website. Eric S. Raymond
has a website. Gwern has a website. And I like their websites. I want to have a
website too. I want to put stuff that I'm learning, and I want to make it fun. So,
I'm going to be building this for fun.

This is *my* website. I am the web*master* of this domain.
