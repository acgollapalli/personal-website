# Part 1: Burnout
So, I fell out of love with software development. I just totally,
completely, didn't want to do it any more. The thought of it would just make me
want to chuck it all out. All the stuff I've learned, the ways in
which I've grown&mdash;just chuck it all out. Throw out my emacs, my configs,
the images of Genera, and the books, and the codebases, and the experience,
and goodness knows what I'd do without it all. How would I live? How would
I eat? But I couldn't stand it anymore.
\
\
I was just done. I still feel just **done**. I've pulled a couple all nighters
learning Next.JS and building this site, because...  Once I get into a
problem, I can't help but push, and push, and push, until either it or I
come undone. It's a character trait. I don't think it's a flaw, because
it's what allows me to be good at what I do. If it's the right problem,
and you're that sort of person, and you have the prerequisite physical,
mental, ability&mdash;whatever&mdash;then that trait can take you a LONG way, even
if you aren't the smartest or most experienced, or most knowledgable
person in the room.
\
\
But... burnout. I went on a trip to Europe thinking it'd fix it. It didn't.
I just came back as utterly unenthused as I'd left. I went to GDC, which
reminded me that I was, in fact, at that point in my career, a game
developer&mdash;a real one! Even though I was spending most of my time slinging
typescript and working on a web platform, I was responsible for a game. And I got some
really, really great ideas, along with the knowledge that on my current career
trajectory, in academia, I probably wouldn't get to do any of it. I felt like
I was just straight up not doing what I needed to do for my life. I knew, I
KNOW, that what I was doing was not going to get me to whatever it is I'm meant
to do on this earth.
\
\
We're an odd bunch, we software people. You see, software develoeprs&mdash;
in our hearts, we're really closer to the same motivational structures
as athletes, or artists, or mathematicians. We want the challenge, and
the hard thing, and the path to glory. We're like Beowulf. As the poem
goes: "and [he] was keenest for fame". It's the very last thing ever
said about that great hero, whose song is still sung over a millenia later
(or at least read by beleaguered english majors more concerned about the
art-hoe two desks down who probably thinks they should be reading Grendel
instead, if she cares enough to think about it all).
\
\
And I admire Beowulf. Deeply. He was a guy who everyone thought was a
slacker, til he set himself up to a crazy challenge to swim the English
Channel, braving and slaying sea-monsters to do it. I'd wager Nessie still
has a few scars from old Beowulf, given how long-lived she is. And when a
monster shows up, a Grendel, a Dragon, this is the guy who shows up. Why?
Because he was the man keenest for fame, and would win it by the means he
had available.
\
\
And the means I have available to me are what? Sitting at desk writing code
for someone who doesn't appreciate it, not allowed to show it off in team
meetings because non-technical people don't have the patience? Pouring hours
into figuring out the right solution, after pulling an all nighter for someone
who will go on to implicitly accuse you of being lazy and not being able or
willing to do the data engineering required, and bring in the *ahem* data engineer that
*you* taught to write CTE's and run the SQL profiler because he's too non-technical
to justify disagreeing with a decision himself. After late nights, extra hours,
being put in charge of a whole other team, in addition to your own, and another
very visible, public-facing side project on top of it, and you get... accused
of not being a good leader. You get recognized by upper management for kicking
tail, and later get accused ***in front of your team***, of being the sort of simperingly
ambitious person who wants to undercut his boss by sucking up to the higher-ups.
Guys like that don't study mathematics; they don't try to start start-ups; and they
don't take game-dev jobs in academia. They go to *business school*. They get MBA's.
I am *better* than that.
\
\
The amount of offense, of deep, personal offense, I have taken in the course of my
career has made me want to hang it up. Chuck it all out. Maybe become a
fighter pilot like I wanted to ever since I was a kid. Maybe join the French
Foreign Legion and marry a French woman. IDK. Man I am ***tired***.
\
\
And so I quit my job. I quit in July. Bare shell of a plan. I thought I'd
rather die than work in software, or in a professional, corporate setting
every again.
\
\
But... after a month I started coding. Just playing around at first. Thought
maybe I'd make something that I liked, and was profitable. And then I
started to enjoy it again. I rediscovered the manic drive that I found when
programming all over again. I enjoy programming. I genuinely enjoy programming.
I enjoy figuring out how to make a thing and make it work. I've been reading
a book on data structures, and I enjoy that. I started doing leetcode, just because
I wanted to give it a shot, and I think I may be one of the few people on the
planet that actually finds it enjoyable. I may hit a problem, and I don't solve
it in 20 minutes, I may take 4 hours, but I *solve* it, and I have a good time
doing it. I **love** this stuff. And that's why I made this site.
\
\
This site is me giving software another shot. It's me giving the software
industry another shot. It's giving myself as a programmer... nah screw being
a programmer, as a *hacker* another shot. This is MY website. Yeah, my resume
is on here, and I'm going to be talking about programming stuff on here. It
may seem a bit LinkedIn lite. But it's *my* site, and I'm going to do things
that are fun on here. If I want to share music I'm listening to, I'll put a
spotify integration, and if I want to have animations *everywhere*, I'll do as
I darn well please. This is my website, and I am the web*master* of this domain,
and I will make this place for fun. It's my fun website, and I'm going to
enjoy it.
\
\
If I do take another software role, it's definitely not going to be at any
place that isn't full of serious people, doing *serious* stuff. CloudFlare,
Netflix, Vercel, Palantir, Anduril, SpaceX, Twitch, idk. Maybe if I was really
into AI, I could learn enough and build enough to get a role at an AI company,
but it's just sort of a mixed bag for me. What I'd really love to do is build a
game hosting platform, host multiplayer servers directly on the edge, and have
players connect directly to the servers for game logic, and have them visualize
the world through a thin client, either rendered (again on the edge) and
streamed into their browsers, or else composited directly in their browsers.
Shoot, I have the background for it. I've worked at a place that did game
streaming, and I've seen the good and bad of it.
\
\
I'd love to build this platform and an engine for it, on the Vercel model of
what they do with Next.JS. But shoot man, the thought of taking money for
programming still turns my stomach a bit. I don't want to program for work
anymore. Unless it's like, really great people, that I respect, I'm working with,
and people who'll appreciate what I do. I don't claim to be a REAL hacker (tm),
or anything. But I feel the desire in by loins to be one. I really do. So I'm
going to go slow, and see what happens. And I'm going to start with this little
art project of a website, and just have fun. Hopefully, I'll enjoy what I'm
doing enough that I actually do what's needed to get a job at a place where I
can really be doing something worth doing, or develop enough as a developer to
actually commit to this crazy idea of mine with confidence, and really reach for
the brass ring. Or maybe I just have fun and find something else to do for a
living.
\
\
Either way, welcome to my website.
\

Hello, world!
